It's a new day. Let's get to work. The first thing I need to do is to write the HTML of the website. 

## HTML
The homepage is going to have a big collapsible menu as the main attraction, with four item, plus a footer. Something like the following:
1. into
2. main section
    * skills
    * projects
    * blog
    * about
    * contacts 
    
Up until now I didn't know anything about collapsible. Time to learn them then!
