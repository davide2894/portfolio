# Project diary

Alright, I have a really bad, ugly, don't-know-where-it-came-from portfolio site that I did back in September, at the very first step of my coding journey. It's a horrible thing to look at (but if you think you're brave enough [go ahead](https://davide2894.github.io/portfolio-old/))

## New year, new portfolio 
During the past few days I have been working on the design while hitting my head against the wall every time I changed my mind.

I must have been struct by a lightening last evening because "Whatch out, whatch out!" I pulled (finally) a mockup outta nowhere (any wrestling fan?).

This is what I came up with.

!!! LINKS OF MOCKUPS !!!


It's a new day. Let's get to work. The first thing I need to do is to write the HTML of the website. 

## HTML
The homepage is going to have a big collapsible menu as the main attraction, with four item, plus a footer. Something like the following:
1. into
2. main section
    * skills
    * projects
    * blog
    * about
    * contacts 
    
Up until now I didn't know anything about collapsible. Time to learn them then! 

1:13pm - have problems with livepreview. need to find a way to update live

## Day 3 - March 3 2018
8:17am - gulp setup is ready, mockups are ready, let's start building the blog.

First, the intro. I think it's better if I also put social icons right away at the top. Let's see.


9:59am - made html bare structure, no coolapsible yet. Set fonts and colors. 
Next is setting project section:
* Projects
    * create small mockup img
    * create img w/mu+cyan bg
    * put bg in project sec with link to gh repo
    
* Skills
    * check good skill sections 
    
* About
    * style text as per mu

* Say hi 
    * style section as per mu

...

5:38pm - collapsible is at a good point, gonna take a break and come back to add animations.

8:50 pm - I'm tired, need to refresh mentally. Tomorrow the first thing to do is to add animations.

## Day 4 - March 4 2018
8:11am - it's Sunday, a new day I use to life my life mission to the fullest. Let's go.
As of yesterday's last update: let's add animation to the collapsibles.

11:16am - now I need to create an overlay with two buttons:
    * visit
    * code
