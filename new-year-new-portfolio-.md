## This is embaressing
Alright, I have a really bad, ugly, don't-know-where-it-came-from portfolio site that I did back in September, at the very first step of my coding journey. It's a horrible thing to look at (but if you think you're brave enough [go ahead](https://davide2894.github.io/portfolio-old/))

## New year, new portfolio 
During the past few days I have been working on the design while hitting my head against the wall every time I changed my mind.

I must have been struct by a lightening last evening because "Whatch out, whatch out!" I pulled (finally) a mockup outta nowhere (any wrestling fan?).

This is what I came up with.
